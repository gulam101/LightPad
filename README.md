Description: LightPad allows the user to create documents and store information which they can retrieve later. Documents can be edited at any time.

Planned features for next few builds:
* *Better interfaces*


**What I learnt**

Better planning using Trello board
Placing comments in the application
Using keyboard shotcuts to reduce development time
Writing cleaner code

How to use GitHub properly
How to track GitHub changes
Hot to revert back to original changes in GitHub
