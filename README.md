Description: LightPad allows the user to create documents and store information which they can retrieve later. Documents can be edited at any time.

Planned features for next few builds:
* *Better interfaces*

Placing comments in the application
Using keyboard shotcuts to reduce development time
Writing cleaner code
How to increase performance
How to use GitHub properly
