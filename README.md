# LightPad
The project was designed so that the user can create a document and then they could add information.

The idea of the project was to make sure that the application could mimic the same features as notepad. Originally, I was going to design the application so that it could support importing images and I was going to use the Microsoft Word toolbar layout which would blend features between notepad and word.

But ultimately, I decided that the application would just be a notepad clone and nothing else.

During this design I learnt how to write cleaner code using C#. I also learnt about the access modifiers and what they could do to each class. I also made the code simple and refined it after every commit. I learned more about the interfaces and how they actually work.
