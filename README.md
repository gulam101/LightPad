# LightPad-final

The idea of the project was to make sure that the application could mimic the same features as notepad. Originally, I was going to design the application so that it could support importing images and I was going to use the Microsoft Word toolbar layout which would blend features between notepad and word.

But ultimately I decided that the application would just be a notepad clone and nothing else. During this design I learnt how to write cleaner code using C#.
